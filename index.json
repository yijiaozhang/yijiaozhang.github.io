Nodes are mapped into points of the space with pairwise distance that reflects their proximity in the network. Popular methods employed in network embedding either rely on implicit approximations of the principle of proximity preservation or implement it by enforcing the geometry of the embedding space, thus hindering geometric properties that networks may spontaneously exhibit. Here, we take advantage of a model-free embedding method explicitly devised for preserving pairwise proximity, and characterize the geometry emerging from the mapping of several networks, both real and synthetic.We show that the learned embedding has simple and intuitive interpretations: the distance of a node from the geometric center is representative for its closeness centrality, and the relative positions of nodes reflect the community structure of the network. Proximity can be preserved in relatively low-dimensional embedding spaces and the hidden geometry displays optimal performance in guiding greedy navigation regardless of the specific network topology. We finally show that the mapping provides a natural description of contagion processes on networks, with complex spatio-temporal patterns represented by waves propagating from the geometric center to the periphery. The findings deepen our understanding of the model-free hidden geometry of complex networks.","tags":null,"title":"Model-free hidden geometry of complex networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi-Jiao Zhang","Zhi-Xi Wu","Petter Holme","Kai-Cheng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"ba831f41b5cae004534819ace3d0f3b1","permalink":"/publication/phys-rev-lett-123-138101/","publishdate":"2019-12-31T04:23:13.998928Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phys-rev-lett-123-138101/","section":"publication","summary":"Multipartite viruses have a genome divided into different disconnected viral particles. A majority of multipartite viruses infect plants; very few target animals. To understand why, we use a simple, network-based susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered model. We show both analytically and numerically that, provided that the average degree of the contact network exceeds a critical value, even in the absence of an explicit microscopic advantage, multipartite viruses have a lower threshold to colonizing network-structured populations compared to a well-mixed population. We further corroborate this finding on two-dimensional lattice networks, which better represent the typical contact structures of plants.","tags":null,"title":"Advantage of Being Multicomponent and Spatial: Multipartite Viruses Colonize Structured Populations with Lower Thresholds","type":"publication"}]
