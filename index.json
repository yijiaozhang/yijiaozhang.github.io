Those representations are considered useful in downstream tasks such as link prediction and clustering. However, the number of graph embedding methods available on the market is large, and practitioners face the nontrivial choice of selecting the proper approach for a given application. The present work attempts to close this gap of knowledge through a systematic comparison of 11 different methods for graph embedding. We consider methods for embedding networks in the hyperbolic and Euclidean metric spaces, as well as nonmetric community-based embedding methods. We apply these methods to embed more than 100 real-world and synthetic networks. Three common downstream tasks — mapping accuracy, greedy routing, and link prediction — are considered to evaluate the quality of the various embedding methods. Our results show that some Euclidean embedding methods excel in greedy routing. As for link prediction, community-based and hyperbolic embedding methods yield an overall performance that is superior to that of Euclidean-space-based approaches. We compare the running time for different methods and further analyze the impact of different network characteristics such as degree distribution, modularity, and clustering coefficients on the quality of the embedding results. We release our evaluation framework to provide a standardized benchmark for arbitrary embedding methods.","tags":[],"title":"Systematic comparison of graph embedding methods in practical tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi-Jiao Zhang","Kai-Cheng Yang","Filippo Radicchi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610582400,"objectID":"7e295f497e61af7dbed72e4d22b87de5","permalink":"/publication/phys-rev-e-103-012305/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phys-rev-e-103-012305/","section":"publication","summary":"The fundamental idea of embedding a network in a metric space is rooted in the principle of proximity preservation. Nodes are mapped into points of the space with pairwise distance that reflects their proximity in the network. Popular methods employed in network embedding either rely on implicit approximations of the principle of proximity preservation or implement it by enforcing the geometry of the embedding space, thus hindering geometric properties that networks may spontaneously exhibit. Here we take advantage of a model-free embedding method explicitly devised for preserving pairwise proximity and characterize the geometry emerging from the mapping of several networks, both real and synthetic. We show that the learned embedding has simple and intuitive interpretations: the distance of a node from the geometric center is representative for its closeness centrality, and the relative positions of nodes reflect the community structure of the network. Proximity can be preserved in relatively low-dimensional embedding spaces, and the hidden geometry displays optimal performance in guiding greedy navigation regardless of the specific network topology. We finally show that the mapping provides a natural description of contagion processes on networks, with complex spatiotemporal patterns represented by waves propagating from the geometric center to the periphery. The findings deepen our understanding of the model-free hidden geometry of complex networks.","tags":null,"title":"Model-free hidden geometry of complex networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi-Jiao Zhang","Zhi-Xi Wu","Petter Holme","Kai-Cheng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"ba831f41b5cae004534819ace3d0f3b1","permalink":"/publication/phys-rev-lett-123-138101/","publishdate":"2019-12-31T04:23:13.998928Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phys-rev-lett-123-138101/","section":"publication","summary":"Multipartite viruses have a genome divided into different disconnected viral particles. A majority of multipartite viruses infect plants; very few target animals. To understand why, we use a simple, network-based susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered model. We show both analytically and numerically that, provided that the average degree of the contact network exceeds a critical value, even in the absence of an explicit microscopic advantage, multipartite viruses have a lower threshold to colonizing network-structured populations compared to a well-mixed population. We further corroborate this finding on two-dimensional lattice networks, which better represent the typical contact structures of plants.","tags":null,"title":"Advantage of Being Multicomponent and Spatial: Multipartite Viruses Colonize Structured Populations with Lower Thresholds","type":"publication"}]
